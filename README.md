I created this repo to store and save my work for the Moshal Urban Mobility hackathon.
The goal was to create a simple web application that to showcase as proof of concept for my group's presentation.

The web application is somewhat operatonal but is incomplete because I did not have enough time to finish making it.
I am very much looking forward to complete it.
